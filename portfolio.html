   about: "The team at Refined Island Creations has simply been amazing. They managed to pull this project off in a timely and efficient manner. It's been an absolute pleasure to work with them; their communication and support throughout were outstanding. The website itself is everything we wanted and more. We, here at Pondok Santi Estate, are grateful to finally have a custom-designed and custom-built website, as it is so much safer than our previous WordPress site. We took a chance to work with such a new brand, but it definitely paid off; I can't recommend it highly enough."
